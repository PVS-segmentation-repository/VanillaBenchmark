The goal is to identify the best-performing configurations per series and visualize comparative results across volumes.\n","\n","### Script 1 – Find Closest Point to (1,1)\n","\n","This script calculates the **Euclidean distance** from each `(sensitivity, precision)` point to the ideal point `(1, 1)`. It then filters the rows that have the **minimum distance** per `SerieName`, assuming these represent the best trade-off between sensitivity and precision.\n","\n","**Steps:**\n","- Load the `Frangi_Beta_CSO.csv` file.\n","- Ensure numerical types for sensitivity and precision.\n","- Compute Euclidean distances to `(1, 1)`.\n","- Select the minimum distance row per series.\n","- Save the filtered results to `CSO_filtered_min_values_by_SerieName.csv`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Script 2 – Plot Sensitivity vs Precision (Organ Region Example)\n","\n","This script generates **line plots** to compare sensitivity vs. precision across volumes for each `SerieName`. Although the current example uses `\"Frangi_Sigma1_Organ.csv\"`, it can be adapted for CSO or other regions.\n","\n","**Steps:**\n","- Load CSV data.\n","- Iterate over each `SerieName`.\n","- Plot each `VolumeName` in a different color with labels.\n","- Add legends, titles, and axis labels.\n","- Display the plot for visual comparison of performance across volumes."],"metadata":{"id":"TjXznb9i8hNm"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mWGUiE3i6rQw","outputId":"a7b22032-c22a-4c04-83ed-5f5913cb4fa7"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["                 SerieName VolumeName  Threshold     TP  TN      FP  FN  \\\n","110010  Frangi_Beta/AAA417   A0.1.nii        0.0  14596   0  691885   0   \n","10000   Frangi_Beta/AFH292   A0.1.nii        0.0  18383   0  723637   0   \n","210020  Frangi_Beta/CBV387   A0.1.nii        0.0  14245   0  601141   0   \n","310030  Frangi_Beta/FBR001   A0.1.nii        0.0  18498   0  686864   0   \n","410040  Frangi_Beta/GPI693   A0.1.nii        0.0   3495   0  600713   0   \n","\n","        sensitivity  specificity  precision  accuracy      Dice  MCC      snr  \\\n","110010          1.0          0.0   0.020660  0.020660  0.040484  0.0  51.7643   \n","10000           1.0          0.0   0.024774  0.024774  0.048351  0.0  54.3750   \n","210020          1.0          0.0   0.023148  0.023148  0.045249  0.0  52.9639   \n","310030          1.0          0.0   0.026225  0.026225  0.051109  0.0  55.9098   \n","410040          1.0          0.0   0.005784  0.005784  0.011502  0.0  61.9952   \n","\n","           psnr    result  \n","110010  32.5449  0.979340  \n","10000   31.5444  0.975226  \n","210020  32.6517  0.976852  \n","310030  31.5162  0.973775  \n","410040  38.7518  0.994216  \n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# Load CSV file\n","df = pd.read_csv('Frangi_Beta_CSO.csv')\n","\n","# Ensure 'sensitivity' and 'precision' are numeric\n","df['sensitivity'] = pd.to_numeric(df['sensitivity'], errors='coerce')\n","df['precision'] = pd.to_numeric(df['precision'], errors='coerce')\n","\n","# Compute Euclidean distance to (1, 1)\n","df['result'] = np.sqrt((df['sensitivity'] -
