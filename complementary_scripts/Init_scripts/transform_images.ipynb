This is critical in medical imaging workflows—especially for segmentation or post-processing—because mismatched header information (such as affine matrices or metadata) can lead to misaligned overlays, incorrect interpretations, or processing errors.\n","\n","### Overview of the Workflow:\n","\n","1. **Script 1**: Creates a dummy binary mask from a loaded MRI image using SimpleITK. It assigns the same header and spatial information as the MRI image to the mask.\n","2. **Script 2**: Creates a dummy zero-filled mask using `nibabel`, saving it with the affine matrix of the original image.\n","3. **Script 3**: Compares the headers of two NIfTI images and prints their differences, helping identify mismatches.\n","4. **Script 4**: Creates a binary mask by setting voxels to 255 where the source image has non-zero values. It applies the header and affine of a second image.\n","5. **Script 5**: Loads an image and forces it to adopt the affine and header of a reference image, saving a corrected output.\n","\n","These tools are essential for ensuring spatial consistency across datasets and are particularly useful in preprocessing for tasks like training deep learning models, applying filters, or anatomical alignment."],"metadata":{"id":"b6juDKEz34eh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install SimpleITK\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2Ism2Z939yea","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717097550864,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6158,"user":{"displayName":"VALERY MOLINA BURGOS","userId":"00215066430852898504"}},"outputId":"2f01ba11-989e-4bc0-9405-71f94747a731"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: SimpleITK in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.3.1)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mxeApuHq9ILI"},"outputs":[],"source":["import SimpleITK as sitk\n","\n","# Load the MRI image\n","mri_image = sitk.ReadImage('AAA417_62_hm_t1_space_sag_p2_0.7iso_nativ_reg2ref_Warped.nii')\n","\n","# Convert the image to a NumPy array\n","mri_array = sitk.GetArrayFromImage(mri_image)\n","\n","# Create a mask where intensity values are greater than zero\n","dummy_mask_array = (mri_array > 0).astype(int)\n","\n","# Convert the NumPy array back to a SimpleITK image\n","dummy_mask = sitk.GetImageFromArray(dummy_mask_array)\n","\n","# Copy metadata from the original MRI image to the mask\n","dummy_mask.CopyInformation(mri_image)\n","\n","# Save the mask\n","sitk.WriteImage(dummy_mask, 'dummy_mask.nii')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nibabel as nib\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","def create_dummy_mask(input_img_path, output_mask_path):\n","    #
